### How to SimpleCalc? :nerd_face:

0. Check the [`Releases`ðŸ“¦](https://github.com/codejack-CR/SimpleCalc/releases) page and download the binary suitable for your OS <br />
**OR** <br />
1. Run from [source codeðŸ’»](https://github.com/codejack-CR/SimpleCalc/tree/main/calc). You need to install PyQt5 first to run the python file. You can use `pip` for that as follows: <br />
```terminal
pip3 install pyqt5
```
2. Run `run.py` or `/calc/__main__.py` :rocket:
3. Smile at the itsy-bitsy application ðŸ¤­. Remember, the author is happy to see you smile :smile:
